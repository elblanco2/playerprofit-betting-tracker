# ðŸ¤– Claude Code Session Handoff

## Current State
- **Project**: PlayerProfit Betting Tracker v2.0
- **Status**: Active development with floating UI improvements
- **Last Session**: Fixed analytics charts, added Ko-fi button, implemented floating navigation

## Pending Tasks
1. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Clear and re-import ALL 10K account data from raw betting history
   - Current data shows 2023 dates causing "734 days since activity" issue
   - Need to update all account data to current dates
   - This will fix the structural "days since activity" problem across all accounts

## Recent Completed Work
- âœ… Added floating Ko-fi donation button with glass morphism styling
- âœ… Updated sticky navigation to floating glass design
- âœ… Fixed analytics charts to display real betting data instead of placeholders
- âœ… Implemented working heat map and balance chart visualizations
- âœ… Reordered navigation tabs: All Bets (default), Import, Add Bet, Parlay, Analytics, Metrics, Discord
- âœ… Fixed table header overlapping issues by reverting to normal positioning
- âœ… Fixed "days since activity" calculation to use most recent bet date instead of config file
- âœ… Updated documentation paths from specific user directory to generic `/Users/x/playerprofit`

## Key Files Modified
- **index.php** - Main application with floating UI, analytics fixes, navigation reordering
- **assets/js/dashboard-enhanced.js** - Real data integration for charts and heat maps
- **README.md** - Updated documentation paths
- **SETUP.md** - Updated documentation paths

## Current Git Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: f31321b - "Fix: Update days since activity calculation and documentation paths"
- **Repository**: https://github.com/elblanco2/playerprofit-betting-tracker
- **Status**: All changes pushed and up to date

## Architecture Overview
- **Backend**: PHP-based betting tracker with multi-account support
- **Frontend**: Modern UI with floating glass morphism design
- **Data**: JSON files for account configs and betting history
- **Analytics**: Chart.js integration with real-time heat maps and balance charts
- **Import**: Multiple methods (CSV, AI Parser, File Upload, API Connect)

## Key Features
- **Multi-Account System**: Standard ($1K-$100K) and Pro ($5K-$100K) accounts
- **PlayerProfit Compliance**: 10% daily loss, 15% max drawdown, 20-pick minimum
- **Phase Progression**: Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Funded (20% profit targets)
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live charts, heat maps, violation monitoring
- **Floating UI**: Glass morphism design with sticky navigation and Ko-fi button

## Known Issues Fixed This Session
- ~~Table header overlapping data rows~~ âœ… Fixed by reverting to normal positioning
- ~~Duplicate violation notifications~~ âœ… Fixed by removing duplicate HTML
- ~~Analytics charts showing placeholders~~ âœ… Fixed with real data integration
- ~~Outdated "days since activity" calculations~~ âœ… Fixed to use actual bet dates

## Development Environment
- **Working Directory**: `/Users/luca/scripts/results/betsize/playerprofit`
- **Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
- **PHP Version**: Standard (with JSON, OpenSSL support)
- **Port**: 8004 (different from main tracker on 8003)

## Important Notes
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: .gitignore excludes data/ folder and *.json files
- **API Security**: Encrypted API key management with AES-256-GCM
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data properly excluded from git
- **Mobile Responsive**: Full mobile support with responsive floating UI

## Next Steps Recommendation
1. Focus on the high-priority task of updating account data to current dates
2. Consider implementing real-time data sync to prevent future date staleness
3. Test the new floating UI design across different screen sizes
4. Validate that analytics charts display correctly with the updated real data integration
